PROJECT: Ruby On Rails Web Application - A Survey App<br>
VERSION: 1.0<br><br>

We made use of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial located at https://www.railstutor
ial.org/book.  Special thanks to Michael Hartl (author of the book and webp
age) for the great tutorial.<br><br>

Accessing the Website:<br>
To run the server, simply run the command:<br><br>

rails server -b 100.73.150.28 (for Kyle) or<br>
rails server -b ............. (for Norm)<br><br>

Then, point your browser toward either:<br><br>

uofu-cs4540-57.cloudapp.net:3000 (for Kyle) or<br>
uofu-cs4540-17.cloudapp.net:3000 (for Norm)<br><br>

Using the Website:<br>
The first step is to sign up as a new user.  Once you are signed up (or log
ged in), you will be able to see all current surveys as well as create your
 own.  The navbar at the top lets you navigate through these options, as we
ll as see your profile and logout.<br><br>

Shortcomings:<br>
There are a couple shortcomings to this website.  The first is that you can
 vote for a survey as many times as you want.  The second is that we are no
t displaying the users that submitted each survey.  Nevertheless, the requi
rement of being logged on as a user in order to see/submit surveys  still r
emains in tact.
