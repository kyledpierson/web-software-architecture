My website

The main webpage at uofu-cs4540-57.cloudapp.net is the landing page for my Azure website.
It contains links in two different ways to other material

1.	The first way is through a normal menu on the right side.  This is a simple, unordered list implementation of a menu.
2.	The second way is through three boxes that animate when hovered over.  Clicking anywhere on the box will link.

These links allow you to access my personal projects, class examples, and information about me.  The personal projects
page only contains one link, which is to the TA application page discussed later.  The class examples page contains all
of the class examples, with the links formatted nicely.  The personal information page simply contains a paragraph about
me.

The TA Application website

The link to this website is found under "My Projects".  It takes the user to a landing page, which explains the other links on the page.
Unlike my other landing page, this one only includes the menu on the right side of the screen.  This contains links to the TA application
itself, the Admin review page, to the homepage, and also back to my own website.
