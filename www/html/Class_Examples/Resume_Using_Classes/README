The following code is a demonstration of how one would 
manage a "resume" generator using PHP classes.

1) Notice use of FILE hierarchy

    - CSS files in separate folder
    - Use of Models folder to hold classes

2) Notice use of navigation bar that "highlights" current page link

3) Notice use of getParam funciton which simplifies the 
   isset code for requests


4) Notice the use of the load_session function to handle startup

5) Notice the use of the build_html_page_header function to
   get rid of replicated code.

6) Notice use of session_destroy (in clear_session.php) to 
   clear the session of data

7) Notice how most pages separate the PHP from the HTML, even when
   in the same file.

8) Minor use of JQuery/JavaScript to make posting jobs more efficient/have
   a better UI.

9) Use of classes to make code easier to use and maintain

   class History --> contains all information about saved jobs
                     can output HTML to show this
   class Job --> contains dates and title
                 can output javascript to generate HTML for this
   class Navigation_Bar --> keeps track of the current page
                            generates HTML to show this
   class Person --> keeps track of a persons details
                    has some error checking functions
   class Resume --> keeps track of person and jobs
                    generates resume output HTML
                    has place holder for a validation method
