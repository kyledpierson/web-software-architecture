ASSIGNMENT:	TA2 – Database README<br><br>

For this assignment, I really wanted to redefine the style of my website, but the database configuring took so much time that I didn't have the opportunity.  I left my website the same as it was before.
I have added all of the functionality that is required of us, which includes:<br><br>

The TA application page<br>
The TA application review page<br>
The Administrator course review page<br>
The Database Schema outline<br>
And this README file<br><br>

Below are my website reviews from the peer meeting<br><br>
From Norm (my partner):<br>
Your home page on your site looks great. I really like that the menu buttons are highlighted when you scroll over them. I also like the movement of the icon in the boxes at the bottom but, they darken and the text is hard to read when they are scrolled over. I would suggest highlighting them instead or changing the color to a more contrasting color. The project pages look cool but I would make them look more similar to the home page. It almost made me think that I had gone to a different site. I also noticed the disambiguate of the homepage. Otherwise looks great.<br><br>

From Melynda:<br>
Your Azure landing page has a lot of cool visual elements to it. I like the way the three main buttons shift as you hover over them and the header of your website with the graphic and the quote is really neat. It feels like you put a lot of time and effort into its design and the overall organization of the website.  Your TA application website is equally as nice, but most of my critique will be here. On the landing page, I have a hard time seeing the blue hyperlinks on the dark background. For the application page, I feel like maybe there’s a better way to display the long list of classes. Either incorporating some JavaScript or using a table to split the list into columns could help this. Everything else looks great.<br><br>

From Joe:<br>
It looks like you spent a lot of time setting up the layout of the website. The layout looks really nice. I like the animated buttons on the home page, and the header. It’s original and well thought out. One of the things I think could be improved is the overall color scheme of the website. I personally found designing color schemes that are pleasing and professional to be difficult, I would recommend looking at googles style guide (http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html). It is very helpful and informative on ways to make your website look professional. I would also recommend some padding on the table on your administrative view to keep the words bumping into the left and top border. I would also suggest using a table or other layout for the class checkboxes so that they aren’t arrayed vertically. The website looks really good, and I can tell you put a lot of effort into it, great job!<br><br>
