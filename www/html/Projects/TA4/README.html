For this assignment, I have moved all data for APPLICANTS, INSTRUCTORS, and ADMINS into objects.  The classes for these objects are in MODELS folders in each respective role's folder.  The classes use functions from the database class to retrieve, store, and parse information.  The objects are instantiated in the VIEW files, which are located in the role's folder but outside of the MODELS folder, and the data can then be pulled from the objects and displayed on the screen via HTML.  There are not many objects used outside of the ROLES folders; however, most of the need for objects was to store information about the roles, and so that is where most of my effort went<br><br>
