For this assignment, I have revamped all of my MySQL statements to be more efficient and easier to read (even though the 
query optimizer is likely doing it for me).  I have also made all SQL statements binded.  I used JavaScript to validate a
new user registration.  This checks for name, email, and password validity, as well as the matching of password to confirmed
password.  I used JQuery to process the actual application form, as well as display relevant information when the
user wants to add more classes or add more applications.  I also used it to validate the form before it was submitted to the
server.  On the server side, I used PHP to validate the classes and applications submitted by the user, to ensure that
only valid classes and applications will full data were submitted to the database.  For ease of use, I used HTML5 to show all
places that input was required, as well as to parse emails and hide passwords.  I am also using htmlspecialchars on my login
and registration pages to eliminate html injection attacks<br><br>
