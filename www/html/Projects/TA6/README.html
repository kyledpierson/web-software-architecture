ASSIGNMENT:	TA6 â€“ Web Scraping<br><br>

-----------------------------NOTE: BELOW ARE THE LOGINS OF ADMINS AND INSTRUCTORS IN THE DATABASE-------------------------<br><br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>

For this assignment, I have added complete functionality to the Admin class view page.  The Admin can choose to view any
class from Spring 2008 until Fall 2015.  If the Admin chooses to view from the Database, the information may or may not exists,
and it may or may not be up to date.  If the Admin chooses to updtate from the Catolog, the information will be scraped from the
appropriate website (for the currently displayed term and year), put in the database, and displayed to the user.  The Admin can
also choose to reset all enrollments to zero, and then re-update the view to make sure that the website is being properly scraped.<br><br>

The course view page also includes nice little javascript and jquery elements that allow the user to expand or compress the title column,
as well as expand or compress the extra information (time, day, loctaion) of each class row.<br><br>

NOTE: The only assignments made and hard-coded into the database are for a few classes in Fall of 2015, so most queries will be empty in the
Assignments column<br><br>
