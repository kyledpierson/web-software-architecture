ASSIGNMENT:	TA7 - AJAX<br><br>

-----------------------------NOTE: BELOW ARE THE LOGINS OF ADMINS AND INSTRUCTORS IN THE DATABASE-------------------------<br><br>

Instructors:<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>

For this assignment, I have updated admin's course view page to display information about applicants and their status.
The admin can first select to pull the classes for a specific semester from the database.  He or she can then choose one
of the offered classes for that term from a dropdown menu, and immediately a table is shown with all of the TAs who have
applied for that course, as well as their status.  The admin can then change the status by changing the dropdown menu.
All changes go into effect immediately. <br><br>

On the Admins view applicants page, all applicants are pulled from the database, as well as their status.  On the admin's
Evalutation view page, a table of all previous TA's (that is, before Fall 2015) are shown.  This table can be sorted by
column by simply clicking on a column header (sorting algorithm from jsfiddle).  Clicking on the show comment button will
show the comment (using AJAX), and clicking the button again will hide the comment.<br><br>

The Applicant's View Applications page has also been updated, so that when an applicant views his or her ta application
for a specific course, the status of that application is also shown (assigned, in consideration, or just simply applied).<br><br>

NOTE: I have supplied applications for any class of any term, however, I have only supplied assignments in my database for
Spring and Fall of 2015.  I have also only hard coded Evaluations for Spring of 2015.  The best results from the class view
page will be either fall or spring of 2015.<br><br>
